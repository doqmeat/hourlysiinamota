## about site
- a siinamota fansite i run :3
- i upload my code using deploy to neocities and github desktop following miss moss's [deploy to neocities template](https://github.com/burned-salmon/deploy-to-neocities-template).
- tested on firefox
- the lack of siinamota wikis and archives inspired me to start this site :)
- currently on <a href="https://sepiarecord.notion.site/homepage-6242b9a7ce844610bdf2a9187a0a1bfb">notion</a> while i get the website ready (this will take a while)
- you can use any of the info and images here for your own wiki or use, anything in here will (most of the time) have a source so please be sure to refer to that as well.
- do not copy paste HTML layout code as a base for your site pretty please. if you do end up doing this i'll be a bit sad but after a week i'll be fine üëç
