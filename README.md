## a siinamota fansite i run @ <a href="https://siinamota.doqmeat.com" target="_blank">siinamota.doqmeat.com</a>

- the lack of siinamota wikis inspired me to start this site :)
- it uses <a href="https://github.com/burned-salmon/deploy-to-neocities-template">deploy to neocities</a>
- currently on <a href="https://sepiarecord.notion.site/homepage-6242b9a7ce844610bdf2a9187a0a1bfb">notion</a> while i get the website ready (this will take a while)
- you can use any of the info and images here for your own wiki or use, anything in here will (most of the time) have a source so please be sure to refer to that as well
