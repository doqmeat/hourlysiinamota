	<main>
		<h2 id="intro">intro</h2>
		<p>my intention with this bot is to let people aware of the amazing and diverse music that siinamota has made, have new people discover his music, and so we (fans) can get bits of his art in our timelines ‚ù§</p>
		<p>please be respectful about siinamota when interacting with the bot. i am not afraid of using the block button!</p>
		<p>you can contact me at <a href="mailto:doqmeat@gmail.com">doqmeat@gmail.com</a> for anything</p>
		<p><b>art credit</b>: icon is by siinamota, background is by meisa</p>

		<h2 id="library">song library</h2>
		<p>(i will soon write all of that in here, but in the meantime use notion)</p>

		<h2 id="changelog">bot changelog</h2>
		<p>i might be studying computer science but idk how most of this works. elon musk fucking sucks so i've been fighting for my life to get this bot running throughout it's course.</p>
		<details>
			<summary><b>known bugs</b></summary> this bot runs on twitter. and let me tell you i am not twitter biggest fan... you may noticed some clips might be glitched out (unable to be played back, incorrect timestamps, song skips throughout the clip, etc) <b>this is twitter‚Äôs fault</b> because the video player is kinda fucked and it has corrupted some of the song clips so. yeah there isn't much i can do :(
		</details>

		<p><b>22.feb.24</b> - now running using <a href="https://bots.agori.dev" target="_blank">bots.agori.dev</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/GuglioIsStupid/status/1754624581078311093" target="_blank">GulioIsStupid</a> <small>thank god</small></p>

		<p><b>20.apr.23</b> - i use <a title="i am aware the link is dead" href="https://twitter.com/GuglioIs2Stupid/status/1644184962273357826" target="_blank">GuglioIs2Stupid</a>‚Äôs (twitter link is dead) <a href="https://github.com/GuglioIsStupid/CBDQ-Python" target="_blank">CBDQ Python template</a> and host it via <a href="https://replit.com/@doqmeat/SiinamotaBot">replit.com</a></p>

		<p><b>07.apr.23</b> - using <a href="https://make.powerautomate.com" target="_blank">microsoft power automate</a> to run the bot thanks to this <a href="https://twitter.com/ALTCODE255/status/1644089177624150016" target="_blank">turorial</a>!</p>

		<p><b>16.jun.23</b> - bot first created running on CBDQ (cheap bots done quick) </p>

		<h2 id="tweet">tweet formatting</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>new song additions</b> to the bot will have <b>[brackets]</b> while the hourly <b>bot</b> will always have a <b>üåü (star) emoji</b></li>
			<li>all song clips have their respective source embedded in the tweet in form of a youtube or nicovideo link</li>
			<ul>
				<li>except on mobile because again, twitter is dumb. but on desktop a link to the source should show up</li>
				<li><b>10.may.23</b> - i no longer have access to twitter media studio (its behind a paywall aka twitter premium or whatever) meaning new songs added to the twitter bot <u>will not have links embed in the video</u></li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<h3>videos used in my tweets</h3>
		<p>i will always try to upload the original song video or PV (meaning without eng subtitles) but sometimes it is hard to come across them which is why some videos have eng subtitles and some of them dont. if theres any problem with the original uploader with me using clips of their translation videos, i will gladly remove them and find another way of uploading the song.</p>
